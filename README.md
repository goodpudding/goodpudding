## üò∫ Cat Lover

Outside the world of code, I'm a huge cat lover. Here are my furry friends:

<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Marshmellow</strong>: My best friend. He's a chill little guy that loves brushes and just hanging out.
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="https://github.com/goodpudding/goodpudding/blob/master/Marshmellow.jpg?raw=true" alt="Marshmellow" width="200"/>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Graham</strong>: My little princess. I rescued her from a farm after finding her with a broken leg.
    </td>
    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

I enjoy sharing photos and stories about my cats, so you can check my instagram [@goodpudding](https://www.instagram.com/goodpudding/) for more. 

## üé¨ My Favorite Movies and Shows

I'm also a big film and series enthusiast. Here are a few of my favorites:

- **Short Circuit**: I just love the thought of a robot gaining sentience and learning about the world. ([link to movie 1's IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_short%2520cir))

- **The Office**: I've watched this over 25 times and can tell you what happens in the episode based off an audio clip. ([link to TV show 1's IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/))

- **Fantastic Mr.Fox**: I absolutely love Wes Anderson, so when he tried his hand at stop motion(my favorite film style) I fell in love. ([link to movie 2's IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432283/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_the%2520fantastic%2520mr))
