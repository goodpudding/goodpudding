# Hi there üëã, I'm [Trey], Aka Goodpudding!

## üò∫ Cat Lover

Outside the world of code, I'm a huge cat lover. Here are my furry friends:

- **Marshmellow**: My best friend. He's a chill little guy that loves brushes and just hanging out. ([link to cat 1's picture](url-of-cat-1's-pic))

- **Graham**: My little princess. I rescued her from a farm after finding her with a broken leg. ![link to Graham's picture](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP3iZEOVnc7KUPhGNz94eXu2mIgotkrS9lQ_yM3DB2YbEYORhe380MG0E8HB4TPDA/photo/AF1QipPTcPdj9R4tEm0wK-5-NWwsfbpRmc-3iE4CUwp2?key=eXVVM25JbGItNi1ZZm91R0UxR2dxNFFlZzUtZTVR)

I enjoy sharing photos and stories about my cats, so you can check my instagram @goodpudding for more. 

## üé¨ My Favorite Movies and Shows

I'm also a big film and series enthusiast. Here are a few of my favorites:

- **Short Circuit**: I just love the thought of a robot gaining sentience and learning about the world. ([link to movie 1's IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_short%2520cir))

- **The Office**: I've watched this over 25 times and can tell you what happens in the episode based off an audio clip. ([link to TV show 1's IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/))

- **Fantastic Mr.Fox**: I absolutely love Wes Anderson, so when he tried his hand at stop motion(my favorite film style) I fell in love. ([link to movie 2's IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432283/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_the%2520fantastic%2520mr))
